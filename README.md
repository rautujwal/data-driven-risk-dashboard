Data Driven Risk Dashboard

1️⃣ Business Problem

Incorrect pricing and prediction errors can lead to significant revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction. This project focuses on analysing prediction errors and translating them into measurable business risk to support better pricing and decision-making.

2️⃣ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains structured records related to product pricing, features, and historical outcomes. It reflects real-world data challenges, including missing values, inconsistent formats, and varying distributions.

3️⃣ Data Preparation & Quality Checks

Key steps included:

Data cleaning and missing value handling

Schema and range validation to ensure realistic inputs

Feature analysis to identify influential drivers of pricing variation

Outlier handling (consider outliers based on domain sensitivity rather than statistics)

These steps ensured the analysis was based on reliable and representative data.

4️⃣ Analytical Approach

Exploratory data analysis to understand feature behaviour and pricing trends

Model-based predictions used as an analytical tool rather than a black-box solution

Error segmentation to distinguish over-prediction and under-prediction scenarios (Risk Analysis)

Business logic applied to convert prediction errors into financial risk estimates.


5️⃣ Risk & Business Impact Analysis

Prediction errors were translated into:

Estimated revenue loss from over-pricing

Potential customer churn risk from under-pricing

Aggregated risk exposure across the dataset

Outputs were categorised into Low / Medium / High risk to support business decision-making.

6️⃣ Visualisation & Insights

An interactive dashboard was developed to:

Monitor prediction distributions

Identify high-risk cases

Summarise overall revenue exposure as a report.

This enables stakeholders to quickly understand where attention is required.

7️⃣ Key Takeaways

Model accuracy alone is insufficient for business decisions

Understanding error impact leads to better pricing strategies

Data validation and segmentation significantly improve trust in analytics outputs

8️⃣ Limitations & Future Improvements

Risk assumptions can be refined using real cost data

Additional monitoring could improve long-term reliability

Integration with live data sources would enable continuous analysis
